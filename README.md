# Nutrition Tracker System

This project is a **Nutrition Tracker System** built with **React** to help users track their daily meals, calories, macronutrients (protein, carbs, and fat), and view a summary of their nutrition for the selected day. It uses a calendar to allow users to choose dates and log the foods consumed for each meal.

The system allows users to:
- Add foods to different meals (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)
- Track total calories, protein, carbs, and fat for each meal and the whole day
- View a summary of the daily totals for calories, protein, carbs, and fat
- Store nutrition data persistently for each day

## Features

- **Calendar Interface**: Allows users to select a date and log meals for that specific day.
- **Meal Tracker**: Add or remove foods for each meal with nutritional information (calories, protein, carbs, fat).
- **Daily Summary**: Displays the daily total of calories, protein, carbs, and fat.
- **Dynamic Update**: Meal and daily summary data update in real-time based on user inputs.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend JavaScript library for building the UI.
- **React Router**: For navigation between different pages (Meal Tracker and Daily Summary).
